Build a high-converting, single-page marketing website for Choppleganger — an iOS app that uses AI to find your "ugly celebrity twin" by matching your selfie against a database of celebrities in their less flattering moments. The website must drive App Store downloads and free trial subscriptions.

Tech Stack: Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion for animations

Design Philosophy: Bold, irreverent, meme-worthy. Think: if Duolingo's chaotic marketing met a premium app landing page. The design should feel native to TikTok/Instagram culture — shareable, punchy, and unapologetically fun.
